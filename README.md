# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES

This repository is used to share material for the RES course taught at the University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, in Yverdon-les-Bains.

The RES course is an introduction to network programming (with the Socket API) and to application protocols (HTTP, LDAP, electronic mail protocols).

## Welcome to the 2017 Edition

The master branch contains the material for the current edition of the course. The material used previous years is available in the **2014, 2015 and 2016 branches** of this repo. You are welcome to check them out, but be aware that the schedule and the instructions will be updated. 

**Use the master branch as a reference!**
